				<p><strong>Version 1.7 (5/1/2014)</strong>: Finally fixes a serious issue where bookmarks were not being saved to your Delicious account unless you saved them twice, or were logged in to Delcious.com in a seperate tab. Such requirements are pretty counter-productive. Rather than taking the time to investigate, I chose to stop using the extension for quite some time. I maintain this in my spare time, and like the rest of the world, have very little of that! <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard.in</a> is a great alternative, and I use <a href="http://iftt.com">iftt.com</a> to keep Pinboard and Delicious in sync. With this fix however, I can now return to the convenience this bookmarklet disguised as an extension provides.</p>
				<p>On a technical note, the biggest change in this realease is I've <a href="https://delicious.com/tools" title="">updated the save URL, as per delicious.com</a> that is used to save links. Using this new save URL, you're now redirected to a page that confirms you've successfully saved a bookmark, and presumably, if link saving fails. This functions just like a Delicious.com bookmarklet would. Also updated was the security policy, which fixes any issues you may have seen with altering the keyboard shortcut.</p>
